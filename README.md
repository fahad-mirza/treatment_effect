# Treatment Effect Visualization using Stata (Sample Code)

The visual makes use of Stata and the built in sysuse Auto dataset in Stata.

The DoFile generates a sample data (you can make your own as well) and then goes on to try and automate the task ahead.
This is not a complete automation of the visualization and requires a bit more tinkering to make it adaptive to all scenarios.

Something to look at later will be multiple treatment arms.
